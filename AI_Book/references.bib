  abstract = {The power system worldwide is going through a revolutionary transformation due to the integration with various distributed components, including advanced metering infrastructure, communication infrastructure, distributed energy resources, and electric vehicles, to improve the reliability, energy efficiency, management, and security of the future power system. These components are becoming more tightly integrated with IoT. They are expected to generate a vast amount of data to support various applications in the smart grid, such as distributed energy management, generation forecasting, grid health monitoring, fault detection, home energy management, etc. With these new components and information, artificial intelligence techniques can be applied to automate and further improve the performance of the smart grid. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques to support various applications in a distributed smart grid. In particular, we discuss how artificial techniques are applied to support the integration of renewable energy resources, the integration of energy storage systems, demand response, management of the grid and home energy, and security. As the smart grid involves various actors, such as energy produces, markets, and consumers, we also discuss how artificial intelligence and market liberalization can potentially help to increase the overall social welfare of the grid. Finally, we provide further research challenges for large-scale integration and orchestration of automated distributed devices to realize a truly smart grid.},

  abstract = {A new nonparametric approach to the problem of testing the joint independence of two or more random vectors in arbitrary dimension is developed based on a measure of association determined by interpoint distances. The population independence coefficient takes values between 0 and 1, and equals zero if and only if the vectors are independent. We show that the corresponding statistic has a finite limit distribution if and only if the two random vectors are independent; thus we have a consistent test for independence. The coefficient is an increasing function of the absolute value of product moment correlation in the bivariate normal case, and coincides with the absolute value of correlation in the Bernoulli case. A simple modification of the statistic is affine invariant. The independence coefficient and the proposed statistic both have a natural extension to testing the independence of several random vectors. Empirical performance of the test is illustrated via a comparative Monte Carlo study.},

  abstract = {The artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been widely used in the transient stability analysis of a power system. They are recognized as the most promising approaches for predicting the post-fault transient stability status with the use of phasor measurement units data. However, the popular AI methods used for power systems are often ``black boxes,'' which result in the poor interpretation of the model. In this paper, a transient stability prediction method based on extreme gradient boosting is proposed. In this model, a decision graph and feature importance scores are provided to discover the relationship between the features of the power system and transient stability. Meanwhile, the key features are selected according to the feature importance scores to remove redundant variables. The simulation results on the New England 39-bus system have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed model over the prior methods in the computation speed and prediction accuracy. Finally, an algorithm is proposed to interpret the prediction results for a specific fault of the power system, which further improves the interpretability of the model and makes it attractive for real-time transient stability prediction.},

A recent example is PG\&E's forced power outage to contain wildfire risk which led to widespread power disruption. This paper focuses on answering two questions: who is responsible for resilience? and how to quantify the monetary value of resilience? To this end, we first provide preliminary definitions of resilience for power systems. We then investigate the role of natural hazards, especially wildfire, on power system resilience. Finally, we will propose a decentralized strategy for a resilient management system using distributed storage and demand response resources. Our proposed high fidelity model provides utilities, operators, and policymakers with a clearer picture for strategic decision making and preventive decisions.},

The primary objective of the related study was to solve the problem associated with the precise prediction of the dynamic trajectory of an autonomous vehicle. This was accomplished by deriving a new equation for determining the lateral tire forces and adjusting some of the vehicle parameters under road test conductions. A Mivar expert system was also integrated into the control system of the experimental autonomous vehicle. The expert system was made more flexible and effective for the present application by the introduction of hybrid artificial intelligence with logical reasoning. The innovation offers a solution to the major problem of liability in the event of an autonomous transport vehicle being involved in a collision.}

We describe performance analyses to compare and evaluate forecasting procedures, and automatically flag forecasts for manual review and adjustment.

  abstract = {'Explaining away' is a common pattern of reasoning in which the confirmation of one cause of an observed or believed event reduces the need to invoke alternative causes. The opposite of explaining away also an occur, where the confirmation of one cause increases belief in another. A general qualitative probabilistic analysis of intercausal reasoning is provided and the property of the interaction among the causes (product synergy) that determines which form of reasoning is appropriate is identified. Product synergy extends the qualitative probabilistic network (QPN) formalism to support qualitative intercausal inference about the directions of change in probabilistic belief. The intercausal relation also justifies Occam's razor, facilitating pruning in the search for likely diagnoses.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {Applying Machine Learning (ML) to business applications for automation usually faces difficulties when integrating diverse ML dependencies and services, mainly because of the lack of a common ML framework. In most cases, the ML models are developed for applications which are targeted for specific business domain use cases, leading to duplicated effort, and making reuse impossible. This paper presents Acumos, an open platform capable of packaging ML models into portable containerized microservices which can be easily shared via the platform's catalog, and can be integrated into various business applications. We present a case study of packaging sentiment analysis and classification ML models via the Acumos platform, permitting easy sharing with others. We demonstrate that the Acumos platform reduces the technical burden on application developers when applying machine learning models to their business applications. Furthermore, the platform allows the reuse of readily available ML microservices in various business domains.},
