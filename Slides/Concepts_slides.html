When the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichor">Ichor</a> was let out, the sculpture stop functioning and “died”.

<p>The Frankestein’s monster is the similar fictional story of the modern times, and humanoid robots are becoming reality today.</p>
<p>While Talos was animated by magical powers, the Frankenstein’s monster was a dead person, in which the life was brought using then recent scientific methods: alchemy, chemistry and electricity, and the humanoid robots are powered by neural networks and deep learning, which is our current technology for creating intelligence.

<h2>Historical methods for AI<a class="headerlink" href="#historical-methods-for-ai" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Axiom based AI</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>developed before 1960s</p></li>
<li><p>small number of axioms are weak in solving complex problems</p></li>
<li><p>it is important to include a rich base of knowledge in the the system</p></li>
<li><p>This development lead to so called <em>Knowledge-Based Systems</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Searching tecnhiques</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Some problems can be solved by searching the space of potential actions step by step, from the database until the solution is found.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Natural language processing (NLP)</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>natural communication with a human being has been one important goal of AI.</p></li>
<li><p>consists of understanding the written or spoken natural language, mapping the semantics of natural language concepts and synthesizing written or spoken texts.</p></li>
<li><p>direct relation to <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing’s test</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Can computer ever be as intelligent as human being?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>At least there can be a seemingly intelligent machine which can communicate with a natural language mimicking human behavior so closely that it is indistinguishable from a human being by a human observer.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Passing the “Turing’s test” has been one of a long term goal for natural language processing and AI.</p>
<p><em>AI in Micro worlds</em>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>AI ideas can be more effectively implemented in a reduced world, when unnecessary details have been removed</p></li>
<li><p>artificially simplistic description of reality, where sufficient AI models can be build.</p></li>
<li><p>Plenty of research has focused on so-called blocks world, which consists of only coloured blocs of different shapes and sizes on a flat surface.</p></li>
<li><p>Also applied to NLP systems which were able to carry out conversations in simple stereotypical situations, without actually understanding the content of the conversation.</p></li>
<li><p>Lot of influence in Many machine vision system, where the world is modeled with simple geometrical shapes created from the images.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these historical methods are fundamental enough to be still in use.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Perceptron is still a core of modern deep learning methods</p></li>
<li><p>NLP is still an active research area.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, today we talk more about weak vs strong AI</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Weak AI</em> or <em>narrow AI</em> are AI implementations for a narrow task in a limited environment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For example, the Siri assistant can understand speech, search data and create virtually intelligent answers without actually understanding the content</p></li>
<li><p>it is not intelligent in the same manner than human being.</p></li>
<li><p>Most (All) of the practical AI implementations today are examples of Weak AI.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>Strong AI</em> or <em>General AI</em> would be AI which is seemingly intelligent</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It could solve general problems by applying previously knowledge in the same manner than human being.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes self consciousness is also listed as a requirement for Strong AI.</p></li>

<p>In Blade Runner movie (1982), agent Deckard is hunting for replicants (AI robots), made by mighty Tyrell-corporation. Watch the scene
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-DkoGvcEBw">Deckard Meets Rachel</a>
and consider, how did Deckard studied if Rachel is a replicant or a human?
What is the connection with so called <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing test</a>?
Why it was so difficult for him to find out the truth in Rachel?  The answer to the last question is in the following scene starting from 1:15
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWPyRSURYFQ">Deckard Meets Rachel, scene continues</a>
How is that related to self consciousness of AI?</p>

<h2>Key drivers for development of AI<a class="headerlink" href="#key-drivers-for-development-of-ai" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Computing power:</em> AI needs powerful processing of information which can be achieved by using fast computers. The fast development of computers has enabled the fast development of AI.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Availability of data:</em> The AI is based on data. The digitalisation of the society has created plenty of embedded sensors and social media which produce a vast amount of data, which can be used for training AI to solve problems. It has been claimed that 90% of the data ever created was created during last two years.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Algorithms and tools:</em> The development of AI algorithms and tools bring AI to be accessible to everyone and accelerate the development of AI itself.</p></li>

<h1>Definition of AI<a class="headerlink" href="#definition-of-ai" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>According to the wordbook definition, AI is present, when a computer or a computer controlled robot behaves like intelligent being.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.<br />
-Ensyclopædia Britannica</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="../_images/AI.png" /></p>
<p>B. J. Copeland seems to agree with this definition, and continues explaining that a human is one of those intelligent beings, which can be used as a measure of intelligence. He further continues that everything a human does is not necessarily a manifestation of intelligence, but <em>reasoning, discovering a meaning, ability to generalize and learning from the past are truly intelligent behavior</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia finds Machine Intelligence as a synonym for Artificial Intelligence and recognizes the intelligence of other beings as humans as well</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. <br />
-Wikipedia</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Russel <a class="reference external" href="http://et.al">et.al</a>. conclude that AI can be human kind of thinking and acting demonstrated by artifacts, but also simply rational thinking and acting. Rational thinking is decision making based on correct rules, “laws of thought”. The rational thinking framework can be based for example on logics, mathematics or statistics.</p>

<h2>Discussion<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>What is the measure of intelligence? What if we meet with an extraterrestial being or an AI which is more intelligent than us. How can we know that it is more intelligent than us?</p>
<p>Definitions of different forms of AI according to the course book (Artificial Intelligence, a Modern Approach, Russel <a class="reference external" href="http://et.al">et.al</a>:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Human like thinking:</strong> Studying how humans think and using the same methods in AI. This approach was used in early AI development but many contemporary methods differ from human thinking.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acting humanly:</strong> Computer systems trying to carry out human like conversations so that they are indistinguishable from a real person. Target ḿay be to complete Turing’s test. Humanoid robots try to mimic human behavior. Acting like human does not necessarily require machien to think like human.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rational thinking:</strong> Making correct decisions based on formal rules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acting rationally:</strong> An artificial agent acts to achieve the best outcome or the best expected outcome in case of uncertainty.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Does the rationality criteria provide a definition of AI which is independent on human intelligence?</p>
