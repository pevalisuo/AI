introduction
============================

This booklet contains part of the material of the course ICAT1100 Artificial Intelligence: Concepts, Challenges, and Opportunities for Fall semester 2020.


## Learning goals

After completing the course, the student is able to:

1. Define and explain various artificial intelligence (AI) concepts, challenges, and opportunities: e.g., problem-solving, knowledge representation, machine learning, decision-making, natural language processing, and expert systems.
2. Explain fundamental algorithms and the related mathematical and programming concepts of AI,
3. List applications of AI in various fields,
4. Use AI software or tools for specific purposes, and
5. Recognize ethical problems related to AI and to suggest constructive solutions to those.
